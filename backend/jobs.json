If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such \nLender or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital \nrequirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on \nthe capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the \nCommitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or the Letters of Credit issued or participated in by \nsuch Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or its holding company could have achieved but for \nsuch Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of its holding \ncompany with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will, subject to the \nprovisions of Section 3.6, pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate \nsuch Lender or its holding company for any such reduction suffered. \n(c) \nCertificates for Reimbursement.

If any Lender requests compensation under \nSection3.1, or requires the Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental \nAuthority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.2 , then such Lender shall use reasonable \nefforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its \nrights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such \nLender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to \nSection 3.1 or 3.2, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any \nunreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The \nBorrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection \nwith any such designation or assignment. \n(b) \nReplacement of Lenders.3 If any Lender requests compensation under Section3.1, if the \nBorrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the \naccount of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.2, if any Lender's obligations are suspended pursuant to \nSection 3.4 or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, at \nits sole expense and effort, upon 10 days’ notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require \nsuch Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions \ncontained in, and consents required by, Section 10), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this \nAgreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which \nassignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that: \n(i) \nthe Borrower pays the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in \nSection10(b)(vi); \n(ii) \nthe assigning Lender receives payment of an amount equal to the outstanding \nprincipal of its Loans and participations in disbursements under Letters of Credit, accrued interest \nthereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan \nDocuments (including any breakage costs and amounts required to be paid under this Agreement \nas a result of prepayment to a Lender) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding \nprincipal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); \n(iii) \nin the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation \nunder Section 3.1 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.2, such assignment will \nresult in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; and \n(iv) \nsuch assignment does not conflict with Applicable Law. \n3 Please note that the Breakfunding section in the Credit Agreement should expressly include any amounts payable as a result of \nan assignment required by this Section. As Loans are restricted to Prime Rate Loans, this issue does not arise.\n",

Upon receipt of such \nnotice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) and \nsubject to the provisions of Section 3.6, prepay or, if conversion would avoid the activity that is unlawful, \nconvert any Loans, or take any necessary steps with respect to any Letter of Credit in order to avoid the \nactivity that is unlawful.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall, subject to the \nprovisions of Section 3.6, also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.  Each Lender \nagrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and \nwill not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such \nLender. \n3.5 \nInability to Determine Rates Etc. \nIf the Required Lenders determine that for any reason a market for bankers' acceptances does not exist \nat any time or the Lenders cannot for other reasons, after reasonable efforts, readily sell bankers' \nacceptances or perform their other obligations under this Agreement with respect to bankers' \nacceptances, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.  Thereafter, \nthe Borrower's right to request the acceptance of bankers' acceptances shall be and remain suspended \nuntil the Required Lenders determine and the Agent notifies the Borrower and each Lender that the \ncondition causing such determination no longer exists.  If the Required Lenders determine that for any \nreason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBO Rate for any requested \nInterest Period with respect to a proposed LIBO Rate Loan, or that the LIBO Rate for any requested \nInterest Period with respect to a proposed LIBO Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost \nto such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and \neach Lender.  Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBO Rate Loans shall be \nsuspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such \nnotice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing, \nconversion or continuation of LIBO Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such \nrequest into a request for a borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. \n3.6 \nOverriding Payment Qualification. \nWithout limiting the generality of Section 5.01 of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be required to \nmake any payment under Section 3.1 to 3.5 or under Section 9 except out of and from Proceeds for \nDistribution as and when such Proceeds for Distribution become available for distribution by the Borrower\nto the Lenders in the UC Receivership Proceedings. \n4. \nRight of Setoff. \nIf an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each of the Lenders and each of their respective \nAffiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time to set off and apply any and all deposits \n(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other \n",

Unless the Administrative \nAgent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any advance of funds that \nsuch Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such advance, \nthe Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in \naccordance with the provisions of this Agreement concerning funding by Lenders and may, in reliance \nupon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a \nLender has not in fact made its share of the applicable advance available to the Administrative Agent, \nthen the applicable Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding \namount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to \nthe Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at a rate determined by \nthe Administrative Agent in accordance with prevailing banking industry practice on interbank \ncompensation.

If the Lender does not do so forthwith, the \nBorrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with \ninterest thereon at the interest rate applicable to the advance in question. Any payment by the Borrower \nshall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that has failed to make \nsuch payment to the Administrative Agent. \n(b) \nPayments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative \nAgent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the \nAdministrative Agent for the account of any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such \npayment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date \nin accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute the amount due to the \nLenders. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders \nseverally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to \nsuch Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to \nit to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at a rate determined by the \nAdministrative Agent in accordance with prevailing banking industry practice on interbank compensation. \n7. \nAgency. \n7.1 \nAppointment and Authority.

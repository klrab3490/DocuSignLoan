# ðŸ“„ Digital Agency Solution â€“ Technical Architecture

This repository contains the **technical architecture documentation** for the **Digital Agency Solution**, designed for seamless integration with the **Loan Book Syndication Platform**.  
The goal is to ensure **robust, secure, and efficient** transition of syndicated deals to the Agency Platform for ongoing management.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

The **Digital Agency Solution** serves as a centralized platform to manage syndicated deals post-origination.  
This document outlines the **architecture**, **integration strategy**, **data models**, and **operational considerations** to ensure high availability, scalability, and compliance.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Areas Covered

### 1. High-Level Architecture Overview
- **Logical View:** Major platform components, relationships, and security zones.
- **Physical View:** Infrastructure layout across environments.
- **Data Flows:** Secure movement of data between components.

---

### 2. Component Breakdown & Design
- **Purpose & Responsibilities** of each module.
- **Technology Stack** for each service.
- **Design Principles** (e.g., microservices, API-first).
- **API Specifications** (REST/GraphQL endpoints, request/response formats).
- **Data Models** and integration points.

---

### 3. Integration Strategy
- **Data Transfer Patterns:**
  - API-led connectivity
  - Message queues
  - ETL pipelines
- **Security:** Authentication & Authorization mechanisms (OAuth2/JWT).
- **Error Handling:** Retry policies, dead-letter queues.
- **Performance:** Caching, pagination, async processing.

---

### 4. Data Model & Database Schema Mapping
- **Core Deal Data Elements** mapping between platforms.
- **Database Schema Comparison** (Syndication â†’ Agency).
- **Identifier Management:** Unique IDs, referential integrity.

---

### 5. Workflow & State Transition Management
- Deal lifecycle mapping.
- Backward compatibility handling.
- Orchestration for complex workflows.

---

### 6. Data Synchronization & Reconciliation
- Real-time sync strategies.
- Scheduled reconciliation jobs.
- Discrepancy resolution workflows.

---

### 7. Scalability Strategy
- **EKS (Kubernetes)** auto-scaling configuration.
- **Document Parser Service** scaling plan.
- **RabbitMQ** high-availability deployment.
- **RDS/Aurora** instance type considerations.

---

### 8. Resilience & Disaster Recovery (DR)
- **RTO/RPO** for critical services.
- DR plan and test results.
- Failure handling & failover strategies.

---

### 9. Security Measures
- Internal network segmentation.
- Secrets management (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
- Vulnerability management & patch cycles.
- Penetration testing plan.
- Security incident response procedures.

---

### 10. Operations & Observability
- Alerting and escalation policies.
- Distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry).
- Runbooks for common incidents.
- Continuous load & performance testing.

---

### 11. Compliance
- Regulatory alignment (e.g., SOC 2 Type 2).
- Audit trail logging & retention.
- Data residency and encryption policies.

---

### 12. Third-Party Integrations
- Rate limits and throttling strategies.
